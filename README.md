# Random-Writer
Analyze transitions between a fixed number of characters (k-grams) in a piece of text, and create a random writer that could randomly generate text that would come next using the Markov model. Utilized the discrete distribution of frequencies (characterâ€™s frequency / k-gram frequency) with the Mersenne Twister Engine to construct a randomly generated string of any length given by the user. 

Commands:\
``make``\
``./TextWriter <k-order> <length> < tomsawyer.txt``
